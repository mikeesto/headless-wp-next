      We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. If
      these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your
      painting and get your floor wet. If you do too much it's going to lose its
      effectiveness.

      You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We don't need
      any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out
      of us. Poor old tree. Maybe there's a little something happening right
      here.

      I like to beat the brush. You want your tree to have some character. Make
      it special. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. If
      it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and
      expect it will get better. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are
      delicate.

      A fan brush can be your best friend. We don't have to be concerned about
      it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Now, we're going to fluff
      this cloud. In your world you can create anything you desire. You're meant
      to have fun in life.

      I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any
      talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I
      do. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Clouds
      are free they come and go as they please. Even trees need a friend. We all
      need friends. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you
      practice you can do.

      We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Just a happy little
      shadow that lives in there. I thought today we would make a happy little
      stream that's just running through the woods here. We must be quiet, soft
      and gentle. Zip. That easy.
